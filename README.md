🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning
Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) at early stages is crucial to prevent vision loss. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fundus images into stages of diabetic retinopathy severity.

📊 Results & Insights
The CNN model was trained on preprocessed and augmented images for multi-class classification (5 DR stages: 0–4).

Used techniques such as image normalization, class balancing, augmentation, and early stopping.

Achieved stable training with the following performance:

Metric	Value (example)
Training Accuracy	85%
Validation Accuracy	76%
Final Test Accuracy	~72%

(Add your loss/accuracy graph here)

Binary classification between "No DR" and "DR" gave better results due to class imbalance in multi-class labels.

🧠 What I Learned
How to apply CNNs on high-dimensional image data for medical classification tasks.

Importance of data preprocessing in real-world healthcare datasets.

Using data augmentation to overcome limited or imbalanced data.

Trained a full image classification pipeline: loading, augmenting, training, validating, and interpreting results.

Understood the impact of model tuning, regularization, and early stopping.

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Imbalanced Dataset: Heavily skewed toward Class 0 (No DR), affecting generalization.

Overfitting: Early versions of the model overfit quickly without dropout or augmentation.

Image Noise & Blur: Many fundus images lacked clarity, challenging model consistency.

Long Training Time: Required multiple Colab GPU sessions to iterate efficiently.

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning in medical image classification. While promising, future improvements like:

Transfer Learning (e.g., using pre-trained EfficientNet or InceptionNet),

Ensemble Models,

Fine-tuned thresholding,

or using segmentation masks,

can improve accuracy and make the model production-ready for screening applications.
